# Pyne Tech Challenge: Fullstack Application Development üöÄ

## Challenge Overview üìä

Your task is to develop a fullstack application that presents a dashboard displaying metrics of New York City taxi trips. This project is estimated to take between 2 to 4 hours.

### Technologies Provided üõ†

We've set up the fundamental tools for you, allowing you to concentrate on the task at hand. However, you're welcome to switch out any of these technologies according to your preference.

- **Frontend Technologies**
  - [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) - For building the user interface.
  - [Tailwind](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) - For styling the components.
- **Backend Technologies**
  - [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - As the web server framework.
  - [Prisma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma) - For database management.
  - [ParquetJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dsnp/parquetjs) - For parsing the dataset

> We recommend installing [parquet-viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dvirtz.parquet-viewer) extension for VSCode to preview the dataset.

### Functional Requirements ‚úÖ

![](sketch.png)

You will implement a dashboard based on the provided sketch above. The dashboard should enable users to:

- Filter data by:
  - Taxi type (options: `all`, `yellow taxi`, `green taxi`)
  - Vendor (options: `all`, `vendor 1`, `vendor 2`)
- View the total distance of trips.
- View the total time of trips.
- See a breakdown of trip fees, also sorted in descending order, with the total amount displayed at the bottom.
- Toggle the metric unit between `miles` and `km`.

Bonus Feature üåü:

- Implement a feature to switch the currency between `USD` and `EUR`, which should be handled on the backend using any free currency conversion API.

### Non-Functional Requirements üìù

- Conversion between metric units should be performed on the backend.
- The design of the dashboard does not need to be complex, but it should be user-friendly and decent.

### Project Structure üìÇ

- The dataset is located in the `data/` directory.
- Define database tables using `prisma/schema.prisma`. Use `npm run migrate` to generate and apply migrations after modifying the schema.
- Data loading should be implemented in `src/scripts/seed.ts`. Execute seeding with `npm run seed`.
- Implement API endpoints in `src/server/main.ts`. Feel free to reorganize files and folders as you see fit for the project.
- Develop the frontend within `src/client`, adjusting files and folders according to what best suits the implementation of the task.

### Taxi trip dataset columns

> Note: Please be aware that column names may vary between the green and yellow taxi data. Columns with differing names are marked with the `‚ö†Ô∏è` symbol below.
